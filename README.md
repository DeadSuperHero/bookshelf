bookshelf
=========

A simple Rails app. Users can post what books they have on their bookshelf, and everything is displayed in a simple grid.

This is just a fun little app I've been coding on the side to better explore what can be done with Rails.

Currently, this runs easily enough with sqlite3 for a choice of database. Support for PostGres is planned; implementing it here is trivial. 

Expect to see a hosted version of Bookshelf soon!

Running:
Just run "bundle install" and "rails s" from the project directory! 

Wanted future features:
* Live AJAX search (in progress)
* A text field for user reviews on books
* Tent integration
* The ability to "Favorite" books
* License tags for searching.
* Possibly pulling in Wikipedia data for author pages?
